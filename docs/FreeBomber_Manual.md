# FreeBomber Manual (WIP)

## 1. üöÄ Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or terminal that can run Java programs
- Recommended screen resolution: 1280x720+

### How to Run the Game
1. Clone or download the project from the repo
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Run `FreeBomber.java` from the `FreeBomber` package

### Controls
- Arrow Keys: Move player
- Spacebar: Plant bomb

---

## 2. üéÆ Game Mechanics

### Player Movement
- 4-directional grid movement
- Player size is 32x32 pixels (matches tile size)

### Bomb Planting & Explosion Timing
- Bomb has a countdown timer of 180 frames (~3 seconds at 60 FPS)
- Bomb explodes in a cross shape: center + up/down/left/right

### Collision & Damage Logic
- Explosions hit enemies and destructible tiles
- Player takes damage if they intersect the explosion tiles

### Enemy Types & Behavior
- `EnemyRock`, `EnemySlug`, etc. ‚Äî move and follow paths or chase player
- Can be destroyed by bomb explosions

### Power-ups
_(To be added if implemented)_

---

## 3. üí£ Bomb System

### How Bombs Work
- When planted, bomb starts countdown (`timer = 180`)
- After countdown, `triggerExplosion()` is called

### Explosion Range & Animation Sync
- Explosion animation covers 5 tiles: center, up, down, left, right
- Collision logic updated to use 5 rectangles, matching animation exactly

### Collision Detection (New Logic)
```java
int tileSize = 32;
Rectangle[] explosionAreas = new Rectangle[] {
    new Rectangle(x, y, tileSize, tileSize),
    new Rectangle(x - tileSize, y, tileSize, tileSize),
    new Rectangle(x + tileSize, y, tileSize, tileSize),
    new Rectangle(x, y - tileSize, tileSize, tileSize),
    new Rectangle(x, y + tileSize, tileSize, tileSize)
};
```

### Bomb Powerups
_(To be added)_

## 4. üß† Code Architecture

### Project Structure
- `Characters/` ‚Äî Player, Bombs, Enemies
- `Background/` ‚Äî Game logic, Tile manager, Panels
- `FreeBomber/` ‚Äî Main game launcher

### Key Classes
- `Bomb.java` ‚Äî Controls bomb logic and animation
- `BombCollision.java` ‚Äî Manages what gets hit
- `TileManager.java` ‚Äî Destructible terrain
- `JackBomber.java` ‚Äî The player character

### Adding a New Enemy
1. Create new class in `Characters/`
2. Extend from `Character`
3. Implement movement logic
4. Add to `Background.java` enemy list

### Modifying Explosion Radius
- Edit `triggerExplosion()` in `Bomb.java`
- Add extra rectangles in same direction for extended range

---

## 5. üé® Sprites & Animation

### File Locations
- `storage/bombs/` ‚Äî Contains bomb and explosion frames

### Naming Convention
- Bomb: `time_cropped_bomb_X.png`
- Explosion: `explosion_cropped_[direction]X.png`

### Adding New Frames
- Add your frame image to correct folder
- Update `getBombImage()` method to include it

---

## 6. üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Bugs
- Collision not aligned? Check `triggerExplosion()` hitboxes
- Enemy not dying? Confirm it's included in explosion checks

### Debug Tips
- Print statements in `update()` or `triggerExplosion()`
- Use colored rectangles to visualize collision zones
