# FreeBomber

Freebomber is a fun and exciting video game where players must find their way through a dangerous maze to reach a hidden door and escape. The game is easy to learn but hard to master because every level brings new challenges, smarter enemies, and tough choices. Your goal is simple: find the door before your health runs out or time expires. But be careful! enemies, traps, and your own mistakes can stop you!

In Freebomber, you move up, down, left, or right on a grid-like map. Walls block some parts of the map you can’t pass, while bushes cover others you can walk through. The door to escape is always hidden, so you must explore carefully. Along the way, you’ll face enemies that chase you. These enemies are dangerous because you lose one of your three health points if they touch you. If your health drops to zero, the game ends.

To survive, you have two bombs you can use at any time. When you drop a bomb, it explodes after three seconds, destroying nearby bushes, enemies, or even hidden power-ups. But bombs are risky if you’re too close to the explosion, you’ll lose health too! After using a bomb, you must wait five seconds before using it again. As you progress through levels, your bombs become stronger and can blast through more areas, but enemies also grow faster and tougher.

The game rewards clever thinking. For example, bushes might hide power-ups like extra health, bigger bomb explosions, or temporary speed boosts. Do you take time to search for these helpful items, or do you rush to the exit? Sometimes, avoiding enemies is safer than fighting them. Other times, dropping a bomb to clear a path is the only way to survive.
