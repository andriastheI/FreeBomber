# FreeBomber

This game is where the player experiences fascinating and intuitive tactical techniques to find a home. What we mean by home is a door that will allow the player to complete the current level. Trust me, it is not as easy as it looks. The game is filled with enemies that will come after you in many directions. Don’t worry! Don’t be afraid; you can destroy and dodge the attacks after you. 
Freebomber is a single-player game where the player can move in 4 different directions(up, down, right, and left) to find a hidden door in a given map. The map contains walls and bushes, where the player can walk through bushes but not walls. In addition to that, there are different numbers of enemies with unique abilities depending on the level. The player is equipped with two bombs that will reset in 5 seconds after being used. The bomb's strength and range will increase with the level, and so will the enemies. 

The game aims to find the hidden door with a life span of 3 health levels. Guess what? You can use hidden power-ups in the bushes. To find those power-ups and eliminate the enemies is where the bombs come into play. The player can drop bombs and detonate them in 3 seconds. The good part is they can destroy bushes and enemies, but simultaneously, they can eliminate the player’s health level by one. So be careful where you drop the bombs; sometimes, running is better than fighting. 

It seems like an easy game, doesn’t it? Plot twist! There is a timer. If the player cannot eliminate all the enemies, unique enemies will come after the player’s location—making the game more enjoyable to play. 

There will be a few levels where the map and enemies will change with the player's abilities, making the game more fascinating and engaging.
